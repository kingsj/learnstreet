    // the playing board. Each object has only one property, ".end", which

    // where landing on the square 'teleports' the user forward or backward in
    // big leaps (see the picture for the UI). An example will be
    //      board[13].end = 47, meaning 14th square ends up in square 48.
    // The special squares, by index and their .end points, are as follows...
    // The "Ladders": 14->48, 19->60, 55->76, 69->90, 78->97.
    // The "Snakes": 99->29. 47->18, 25->7.
