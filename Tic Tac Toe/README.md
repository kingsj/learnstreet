Welcome! Here is a Tic Tac Toe project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using python.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

In the Tic Tac Toe project, you will implement the checks for winning a Tic Tac Toe game. In addition, you will add a method that the computer will use to make moves. After the methods are added, you will be able to play the computer in Tic Tac Toe. The score obtained will be displayed (that part you do not need to implement: we've taken care of that!).

Try it out!
