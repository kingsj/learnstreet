Welcome! Here is a Blackjack game project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using python.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

Here is a blackjack game that needs some code for it to work.<br> Complete the outlined methods to shuffle the deck, count up the points in your hand of cards, draw new cards to add to your total score, and to give the dealer a strategy.<br> Once you're finished, challenge the dealer and see if you can beat the house!
