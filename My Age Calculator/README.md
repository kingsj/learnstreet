Welcome! Here is a My Age Calculator project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using python.

Project description

The Age Calculator project displays information regarding entered data. It can display days left, hours left, and seconds left until one's birthday based on input. <br>
It handles leap years and accurate calculations by the current time.
