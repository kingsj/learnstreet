Welcome! Here is a Bank Teller project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using javascript.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

In this project, you will build a bank simulator/ATM Machine.
<br>
Upon completion it is possible to log in and create multiple accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and transfer funds. Error messages and popups are shown and a easy-to-use GUI is implemented.


Try it out!
