Welcome! Here is a Minesweeper project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using javascript.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

In this project, you will be building a Minesweeper game. The game consists of a <code>9x9</code> game board (beginner-level) and contains 10 mines. The object of the game is to click the squares and reveal all squares that are not mines.
<br> <br>
When a square that is not a mine is clicked, more information about the board is given. With strategy and practice, the game is winnable around 90-95% of the time. 
<br><br>
In this project, you will be writing the board generation of the game. Once this is done, the game will be complete and you'll be able to play it!

Try it out!
